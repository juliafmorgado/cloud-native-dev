# Challenge 2 :: Cloud Native Applications Persistence


In this challenge we will take the application that we coded in #1 and store its data using two different approaches. 
Before starting create a challenge-2 directory, copy the application code from challenge-1 and push that to git, then: 
- Create a branch (called `fs` or `filesystem` from the `main` branch and store the list of texts saved into a file (using the file system APIs provided by your programming language of choice)
- Create a branch (called `sql`) and store the list of texts into a table inside an SQL database of your choice. Recommended PostgreSQL, but you can choose any SQL database that you want

## Deliverables 

Create a README.md to explain how to run both versions of the application by switching branches. 
Make sure that both branches with fully functional applications are pushed to your GitHub repository. 

## Important Lessons Learned
- Dealing with files (reading and writing files) to make the application work after it is shutdown
- Dealing with dependencies in your language of choice
- Learning basic SQL to store and read data. Learning how to run and use a database.
- Dealing with branches in Git
