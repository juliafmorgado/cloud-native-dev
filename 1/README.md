# Challenge 1 :: Cloud Native Applications

On this challenge we will be creating a simple application, you can use any programming language you want.

The objective of this challenge is to prove that you can build simple applications that include simple frontends and backends.

1) Expose a web page with a text area and a button. This button calls the endpoint describe in 2
2) Create a backend with an HTTP endpoint ('/save') that takes the content of the text area and keeps it in an in memory collection (slice or array)
3) Create another HTTP endpoint ('/all`) that returns all the elements stored in the collection
4) Add to the web page the list of saved elements in the backend.

## Deliverables

You need to create a GitHub repository that contains the follwing structure:

```
challenge-1/README.md <- the instructions to build, run and test the application locally. 
challenge-1/app/ <- the source code of the application
```

You should push all the code required for me to run the application after forking your repository.
