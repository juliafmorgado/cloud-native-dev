# Challenge 1 :: Cloud Native Applications

In this challenge, we will create a simple application, and you can use any programming language you want.

This challenge aims to prove you can build simple applications with simple frontends and backends.

1) Expose a web page with a text area and a button. This button calls the endpoint described in 2
2) Create a backend with an HTTP endpoint ('/save') that takes the content of the text area and keeps it in an in-memory collection (slice or array)
3) Create another HTTP endpoint ('/all`) that returns all the elements stored in the collection
4) Add the list of saved elements in the backend to the web page.

## Deliverables

You need to create a GitHub repository that contains the following structure:

```
challenge-1/README.md <- the instructions to build, run, and test the application locally. 
challenge-1/app/ <- the source code of the application
```

After forking your repository, you should push all the code required for me to run the application. 

## Important Lessons Learned

- Creating an HTTP server and exposing endpoints
- Basic Client-Server architecture and how the web works.
